    <h3>Biography</h3><br>
    <p>Hi this is Fernando as you can see i prefer to be called by my middle name, I am 22 years Old and i started playing basketball when i was 8 years old but a funfact about this is that my favorite sport it was soccer but in my town the soccer game used to be on sundays so my mom told me that i cannot play on sundays because is the sabbath day at the beggining i didn't understand her but with the time i became a great basketball player in my town but to be honest, basketball it was boring to me but with the time i began to love it and know i am better playing basketball but i prefer to watch soccer games more than basketball games, other thing about me is that i took a course about programming during 6 months and i got a job a Junior Programmer during 6 months i learned a lot, now i am living in United States because in this career yes or yes you need to be a English Speaker, i am working, studying english and earning my degree in BYUI, you know that its hard to do all the things at the same time but  its worth it.</p>
