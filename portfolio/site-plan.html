        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        In our home page, we aim to create a welcoming atmosphere with user-friendly navigation. The wireframe may not reflect our chosen color scheme and background imagery, which will be carefully curated to resonate with our brand's identity and offer an engaging visual experience.
      </p>
      <img src="images/H.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>My Portfolio</h3>
      <p>     
        Our portfolio section will showcase a diverse range of projects, but the wireframe doesn't convey the interactive features. Visitors can click on each project to access detailed information, images, and links to project resources, creating an immersive and informative journey through our work.    
      </p>
      <img src="images/D.jpeg" alt="page 2 wireframe">

      <h3>My Soft Skills</h3>
      <p>         
        When it comes to my soft skills, the wireframe may not illustrate the seamless communication, adaptability, and collaborative approach that I bring to the table. These skills enhance teamwork and problem-solving, creating a positive work environment and fostering effective interactions with colleagues and clients.
